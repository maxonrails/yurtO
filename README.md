###9. Be clear on what's going to give

In a perfect world everything would always be perfect but sadly there never will be enough time, money and sanity to complete everything, you have to decide what you're willing to give on and what has to stay firm.
The main 4 are:
* Time  
* Budget  
* Scope  
* Quality

Draw some sliders with 4 points from on, to off, no thing can occupy the same position
